     <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
     <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
     <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
     <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
     <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
     <li>1 cup buttermilk </li>
     <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
     <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
     <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
     <li>¼ cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Brownie Swirl</p>
   <ul>
     <li>1 (18.25 ounce) package brownie mix (such as Betty Crocker®)</li>
     <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
     <li>2 eggs</li>
     <li>¼ cup water</li>
   </ul>
  <h4>Steps:</h4>
   <ol>
     <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9-inch baking pan with parchment paper; grease parchment paper with cooking spray.</li><br>
     <li>Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.</li><br>
     <li>Combine buttermilk, egg, butter, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl, beating to break up the egg. Add flour mixture; stir until just combined. Fold chocolate chips gently into the batter. Allow batter to rest for 5 minutes.</li><br>
     <li>Combine brownie mix, oil, eggs, and water in a large bowl; whisk together until smooth.</li><br>
     <li>Pour 1/2 cup of the brownie batter into a squeeze bottle, pastry bag with a small round tip, or large resealable plastic bag with corner snipped off. Reserve remaining batter.</li><br>
     <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Drop 1/3 cup pancake batter into the skillet, shaking skillet to spread batter evenly. Drop 5 nickel-size dollops of brownie batter over the pancake; swirl using a skewer or knife edge. Cook until edges are dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until set on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batters.</li><br>
     <li>Pour reserved brownie batter into the prepared pan.</li><br>
     <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 28 to 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack before slicing.</li><br>
